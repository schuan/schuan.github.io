<p>
Dear Applicants,
  
<br>
I greatly appreciate your interest in my research. However, if you meet the following criteria, you may need to further strengthen your research before contacting an advisor:

  <br>
  1. Someone who never gets any A letter grade in his/her undergraduate/graduate studies.

  <br>
  2. Someone who continues graduate study because he/she cannot find an engineering job or may lose status.

  <br>
  3. Someone whose GPA is below 3.3/4.0.

  <br>
  4. Someone who hires an educational agency to ``decorate'' their resume.

  <br>
  5. Someone who gets a first place in a ``national'' competition, for which 1000 first places are awarded.

<br>
Best,

<br>
Sanchuan
