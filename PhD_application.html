Dear Applicants,

I greatly appreciate your interest in my research. However, if you meet the following criteria, you may need to further strengthen your research before contacting an advisor:

  1. Someone who never gets any A letter grade in his/her undergraduate/graduate studies.

  2. Someone who continues graduate study because he/she cannot find an engineering job or may lose status.

  3. Someone whose GPA is below 3.3/4.0.

  4. Someone who hires an educational agency to ``decorate'' their resume.

  5. Someone who gets a first place in a ``national'' competition, for which 1000 first places are awarded.

Best,

Sanchuan
